## Experiences

In my professional journey, I've gained significant experience in cloud architecture, automation, and project management. Over three years, I assumed various roles, including Tech Lead and Scrum Master, on innovative projects. Notably, I contributed to the development of a serverless and cloud-native product on a major cloud platform. This work involved domains such as IoT, Machine Learning, and specialized water treatment. I played a pivotal role in migrating a substantial global platform to microservices, optimizing cost and data management by orchestrating API Gateways and fine-tuning databases for various use cases. Furthermore, I implemented a single sign-on portal and provided strategic insights to top management while ensuring observability across applications and infrastructure in the Digital Factory.

In another role, I served as a Tech Lead and Scrum Master for a project that bolstered data management and governance. This role was crucial in facilitating the efficient operation of data scan processes across various platforms and cloud providers. These experiences have honed my proficiency in cloud architecture, problem-solving, and fostering innovation in digital projects.
